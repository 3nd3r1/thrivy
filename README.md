# Thrivy

**Thrivy** is my Junction 2024 submission, built to connect talent with companies based on shared values and well-being, not just skills.

## How It Works

- **Employees**: Answer a quick ThriveScore questionnaire to see how well your job aligns with your values and satisfaction.
- **Job Seekers** (future): Find companies that match your goals and work preferences.
- **Companies** (future): Showcase your values and culture and view real feedback on how employees thrive at your company.

**ThriveScore** empowers talents to make informed decisions, focusing on workplaces where they can truly thrive.
